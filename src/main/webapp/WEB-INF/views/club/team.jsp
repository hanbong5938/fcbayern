                            FC Bayern is a company, but in the first instance it is a club with the membership at
                            its
                            core.
                            With more than 270,000 members, FC Bayern is the biggest club in the world. From the
                            earliest
                            days, the club has met its responsibilities to the community by developing young talent
                            and
                            emphasising grassroots sport. This is by no means restricted to football. FC Bayern
                            teams
                            actively compete in basketball, handball, chess, veterans’ football, sports skittles,
                            table
                            tennis and gymnastics, some at elite national levels. And with more than 100 referees,
                            the
                            club
                            boasts Europe's biggest refereeing section. FC Bayern as a club is firmly anchored in
                            grassroots
                            sport.

                            Following on from the Grünwald Stadium and later the Olympic Stadium, the stunning ground in
                            the
                            north of Munich is the third home venue in Bayern’s long Bundesliga history, and certainly
                            the
                            most spectacular. Europe’s most modern stadium, with a capacity of more than 70,000, has
                            already
                            established itself in the collective conscience of football fans all over the world within a
                            short timescale.

                            Visitors continue to be particularly impressed by the facade. 2,760 diamond-shaped cushions
                            form
                            the world’s biggest membrane cladding covering an area of 66,500 m². Even if it is not your
                            first visit, it’s hard to believe the evidence of your own eyes at night matches when the
                            whole
                            stadium appears to be red when viewed from the outside. The three-tier interior of the
                            Allianz
                            Arena has extraordinary acoustics that rapidly turn the stadium into a cauldron when hosting
                            thrilling encounters.

                            It is no surprise that the Allianz Arena is nearly always full to the rafters. Around two
                            million fans visit the stadium every season with all 71,000 available seats and standing
                            places
                            being sold out for all 17 Bundesliga home games. Bayern’s incredible attendance record
                            invariably includes 68,000 full houses for European fixtures (the capacity is reduced by
                            3,000
                            in the all-seat configuration). As a rule, shortly after the Bundesliga fixtures are
                            announced
                            at the beginning of July, more than half of Bayern’s league games in the Allianz Arena sell
                            out
                            at once.

                            What brings the fans streaming to Fröttmaning in their tens of thousands? The stars of the
                            mighty Bayern Munich of course. But the fans can also expect to be well looked after, both
                            before and after the game. 6,000 m² of catering facilities take care of culinary
                            requirements.
                            Europe’s biggest multi-storey car park provides nearly 10,000 parking spaces.

                            Since May 2012 there has been another compelling reason for fans and families to flock to
                            the
                            stadium in droves: the FCB Erlebniswelt, housed at the Allianz Arena and already established
                            as
                            a must–see attraction for thousands of the five million visitors to Munich every year.
                            Germany’s
                            biggest club museum tells the absorbing story of the club in an interactive installation
                            covering more than 3,000 m².

                        <p class="mt-3">
                            The exhibition on Level 3 of the Allianz Arena features much more than countless fascinating
                            exhibits, including trophies, and boots and shirts worn by Bayern greats past and present.
                            The
                            113–year history of one of Europe's most famous and successful clubs is retold using an
                            intoxicating blend of facts and infotainment, modern and emotionally moving, but at the same
                            time entirely authentic. Trophies, cups and more than 500 exhibits are displayed using
                            award-winning media technology and interactive elements, drawing in football enthusiasts big
                            and
                            small, lovers of sport, and visitors who are simply inquisitive.

                            After experiencing the FCB Erlebniswelt, visitors enter the gigantic FC Bayern Megastore,
                            now
                            expanded and modernised, and an even more attractive proposition than ever before. Official
                            merchandise dedicated to Germany’s most successful club fills almost 1,000 m², and is the
                            widest
                            range offered by any Bundesliga club with more than 500 items for fans.

                            A big plus point for the Arena is its ability to match the needs of a broad range of
                            supporters.
                            There are 13,500 reasonably priced tickets for the standing terraces at Bundesliga games.
                            2,200
                            business seats and 106 executive boxes with a total of 1,374 seats provide the perfect
                            surroundings for entertaining and commerce. And everything is done for wheelchair users:
                            there
                            is single level access to all 165 reserved seats.

                            This architectural wonder was conceived by world-renowned architects Jaques Herzog and
                            Pierre de
                            Meuron. Particular pride can be taken by the fact that the Allianz Arena was positively
                            welcomed
                            by the Munich public. In a referendum held in the autumn of 2001 an overwhelming majority of
                            65.8 percent of Munich citizens voted in favour of the construction project. The foundation
                            stone was laid on 21 October 2002. Less than three years later, Bayern Munich faced Germany
                            on
                            31 May 2005 for the opening match in the Arena.

                            Bayern are now the sole shareholders in the Allianz Arena. TSV 1860 Munich, who were
                            originally
                            joint occupants of the stadium, are now tenants up to 30 June 2025. According to a survey
                            conducted by political journal “Cicero”, the Allianz Arena became Germany’s favourite sports
                            venue, and one of the top ten national sites of interest in the country just three years
                            after
                            it was built.
